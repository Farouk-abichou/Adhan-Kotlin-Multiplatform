# Adhan Kotlin Multiplatform

## Adhan Kotlin Multiplatform is a well-tested and well-documented library for calculating Islamic prayer times, now available for multiplatform development. Adhan Kotlin Multiplatform is written to be compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform projects, enabling use on iOS, Android, Web, and desktop applications.

Adhan Kotlin Multiplatform is designed with compatibility in mind, targeting the JVM for Android and other platforms, as well as Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS. It offers a small method footprint and has no external dependencies, making it an efficient choice for multiplatform applications.

All astronomical calculations within the library are high precision equations adapted from the book [Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus] (https://shopatsky.com/collections/willmann-bell) . This authoritative resource is highly recommended by the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for its reliability and precision.

For developers interested in implementations of Adhan in other programming languages, please refer to the parent repo, [Adhan]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/batoulapps/Adhan)), where multiple language implementations are available.
